Hi! In order to deploy the project, you need to go to the root folder starburst, you need to open the console and run the command **npm i**. 
This command install the necessary packages, for further work, when developing.

# Team to create a version for the production project
In the console, enter the **npm run build** command. This command will start the process to build the project and upload to the production. In the future, the dist folder will be created in the root directory, where there is a ready site. Path: starburst/dist
Current versions: node.js 10.16.0, npm 5.6.0, webpack@4.36.1
# Important: the computer must be installed node.js.
My regards, Alex.
